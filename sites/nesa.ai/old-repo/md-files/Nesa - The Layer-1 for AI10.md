INFRASTRUCTURE
As a permissionless network, Nesa uses Proof-of-Stake to secure its own consensus. Like
in other Proof-of-Stake networks, any user can help secure the network and vote on
model updates by delegating their NES to a Nesa validator for a portion of their validator’s
staking rewards.
IBC-ena bled Proof-of-Stake
Network
Nesa is a secure IBC-enabled decentralized Proof-of-Stake network with options for both
CosmWasm and EVM native developers.
By leveraging TEEs, we ensure that all data processed by Nesa's
inference committee remains confidential and tamper-proof
throughout the entire inference lifecycle.
Central to Nesa's commitment to privacy and security in the evaluation of AI models is the
integration of Trusted Execution Environments(TEE). TEEs provide a secure area within a
main processor, ensuring that sensitive data and operations are insulated from the rest of
the system during the inference process and throughout Attestation.
