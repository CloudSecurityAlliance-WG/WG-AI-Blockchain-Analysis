As the AIVM matures, our vision for its future encompasses not only expansion in
capabilities but also a strong emphasis on interoperability. This is crucial to ensuring the
AIVM is an adaptable platform that can seamlessly integrate with the broader ecosystem of
decentralized technologies and cater to a growing range of use cases.
NESBridge facilitates cross-chain interactions on the NES network, enabling the AIVM to
interoperate with different blockchain networks. This protocol allows for the transfer of
models, data, and even computational tasks across platforms, contributing to a more
integrated and powerful decentralized AI offering for Kernels on Nesa. Nesa's network
interoperability has the potential to establish standards for AI model execution and storage
on distributed ledgers for the industry as it brings more partner networks into the
ecosystem.

https://nesaorg.gitbook.io/nesa/nesa-gitbook/background-information/interoperability-and-aivms-future-plans 2/3As we move to the main net, we plan to update the AIVM for a wider array of AI models and
inference scenarios. This includes scaling up to handle larger and more complex models,
integrating new machine learning frameworks, and adopting the latest advancements in AI
research to provide users with a state-of-the-art execution environment.
The AIVM is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for components to be added,
removed, or upgraded without disrupting the overall system. This flexibility ensures that the
AIVM can adapt to new requirements and technologies as they emerge, fostering long-term
sustainability and growth.
PreviousL2s connecting to Nesa by adapter. L2’s are representative of any blockchain based service in the AI
domain, not just a Layer 2. The L2 posts data to Nesa and Nesa communicates back with the L2 to
ensure proper data format and quality. From there, results are sent to Nesa’s Consensus and Execution
Layer, and then rolled up for settlement.
