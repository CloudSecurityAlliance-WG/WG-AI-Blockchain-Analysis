https://nesaorg.gitbook.io/nesa/nesa-gitbook/overview-of-usdnes 1/6Overview of $NES
Nesa's native asset, $NES, is an essential part of how developers build on the first
autonomous AI oracle network for on-chain inference. To use Nesa for AI model inference,
rollup developers submit PayForQuery transactions on the network for a fee, denominated
in $NES.
A core part of the NES vision is that deploying an AI update and querying the model should
be as easy as calling a smart contract. In this era of AI progress, developers no longer need
to handle every part of the pipeline if they want their AI output to be trusted, accurate, and
immutable. Nesa does the heavy lifting.
Just as ETH is used on Ethereum-based rollups, developers can opt to bootstrap their AI
model update quickly through Nesa by using $NES as a gas token and currency in addition
to paying for query availability.
On the Nesa mining network, any user can help secure the network and vote on model
updates by delegating their $NES to a Nesa validator for a portion of their validator’s
staking rewards.Role of NES

https://nesaorg.gitbook.io/nesa/nesa-gitbook/overview-of-usdnes 2/6$NES staking also allows the community to play a critical role in decentralized governance
over key parts of Nesa such as voting on model query parameters through governance
proposals and governing the community pool which receives 2% of block rewards.
$NES inflation starts at 8% annually and decreases by 8% every year until it reaches the
long-term issuance rate of 1.8%. The image below displays annual inflation over the next 20
years. 
The annual provisions for inflation are calculated based on the total supply of $NES at the
beginning of each year. To calculate how much $NES to issue per block,
Nesa uses the block timestamp rather than the block height given the time between blocks
can vary and cause actual issuance to be higher than the target.NES inflation over the next 20 years. $NES inflation starts at 8% annually and decreases by 8% every

https://nesaorg.gitbook.io/nesa/nesa-gitbook/overview-of-usdnes 3/6Nesa will have a total supply of 1,000,000,000 $NES at Genesis, split across five core
allocation categories. The chart below describes each core allocation group. 
Nesa plans to use allocation from the Incentivized test net to reward developers who
contribute to the Nesa ecosystem, who build on Nesa, who submit their AI Models for use
on Nesa, and early miners who lend their compute power for reward. 
The earliest supporters of Nesa will be the recipients of the largest portion of the
Incentivized test net token allocation. In addition to being early on the platform, regularly
submitting PayForQuery transactions on the system through an AIVM Kernel results in a
higher score for incentive rewards. For direction on how to earn $NES, the Nesa community
channels are the best source of information. 
The Genesis drop can include $NES token allocated on both decentralized and centralized
platforms, to be announced in Nesa community channels leading up to listings.

https://nesaorg.gitbook.io/nesa/nesa-gitbook/overview-of-usdnes 5/6Nesa's 1 billion $NES supply at Genesis will be subject to several different unlock
schedules. All tokens, locked or unlocked, may be staked, but staking rewards are unlocked
upon receipt and will add to the circulating supply.
Circulating supply is defined as the amount of $NES tokens in general circulation without
on-chain transfer restrictions, including lock-ups.
Available supply is defined as the amount of $NES tokens that are either part of the
circulating supply or are unlocked but subject to some form of governance to determine
when the tokens are allocated. This includes the unlocked portion of the R&D & Ecosystem
tokens and the tokens set aside for future initiatives beyond the Genesis drop and
Incentivized testnet.
