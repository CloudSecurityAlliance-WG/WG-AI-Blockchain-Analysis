The Nesa team envisions a future where AI models become so critical to daily life that they
assume the role and level of importance of today’s mobile app ecosystem, like those on
operating systems like Google and Apple, where they are sellable and monetizable in an
open marketplace.
OpenAI’s marketplace of GPTs operates on OpenAI’s private model, closed off to the public,
meaning a model that is off-chain and not connected to any decentralized environment,
and customizable only via OpenAI’s black box fine-tuning. The work invested into careful
fine-tuning and model update provenance can evaporate overnight under such a setup.
This is the inherent danger of centralization and AI.
The future that we envision is an AIVM Kernel Marketplace where containerized AI’s on the
Nesa could be browsed through, reviewed, piloted, and purchased in an instant to handle
any task that a user requires. Nesa wants to give freedom and complete flexibility to
creators who want to own, monetize, and control their AI evolution. Each container in the
Kernel Market would be fully customized, controlled, updated, and managed by its owner.
