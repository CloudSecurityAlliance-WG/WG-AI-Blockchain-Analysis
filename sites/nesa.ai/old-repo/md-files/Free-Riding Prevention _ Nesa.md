A potential vulnerability in any decentralized system is the risk of free-riding, where one
party seeks to gain the outcomes of a shared effort without contributing its fair share of
work. In the context of our decentralized inference system, this would manifest as a node
waiting for others to submit inference results, then copying and submitting those results as
their own, thereby conserving their computational resources illegitimately.
To mitigate this risk, we have designed a unique security mechanism that divides the
second transaction phase into two distinct sub-phases, each with its transaction: the
Commit phase and the Reveal phase.
In the Commit phase, nodes in the inference committee must submit a cryptographic
commitment of their inference results. This commitment is a one-way hash of the result
combined with a secret nonce, providing a way to lock in the result without exposing its
content, i.e., H(m||r), where H is the hash function, m is the result, and r is a random nonce.
The commitment ensures that the node has performed the computation and is ready to
reveal the valid result. This phase has a specified timeout limit within a fraction of the slot
duration. Failure to submit a commitment within this window results in the node being
ineligible to reveal its results and facing a penalty.
We list the detailed off-chain and on-chain algorithms for the commit phase
Following the Commit phase, the Reveal phase allows nodes to disclose their previously
committed results. Each node must reveal both the result m and the nonce r used in the
commitment, allowing others to verify the hash against the commitment made in theThe Commit Phase

different result from what was committed, will result in punitive measures against the
offending node.
The introduction of the Commit/Reveal scheme effectively prevents free-riding by ensuring
that each node provides evidence of its contribution before any results are made public.
This two-step process requires nodes to stake their claim on an outcome without
knowledge of other nodesâ€™ work, thus ensuring that each node contributes independently.
By employing a cryptographic commitment scheme, we create a trustless environment
where work cannot be copied, and honesty is enforced through the threat of penalties.
These penalties for non-compliance act as a strong deterrent against malicious activity,
helping to maintain a fair and secure environment for all participants. The Commit/Reveal
protocol guarantees that only nodes that genuinely perform the computations are
rewarded, thereby upholding the integrity of the decentralized inference process and
protecting the system from exploitation.
This careful orchestration of transactions and timings ensures that our network remains
resilient, efficient, and free from the inefficiencies and unfair practices that free-riding
would introduce.
