## Initial thoughts around this space:

* I'm not sure if execution of workloads in a secure manner is worth chasing technology vs contractual guarantees with a company like Microsoft
* Decentralized vs Centralized, see cloud, the large players can do things at scale that the small players can only dream of
* I suspect a better way forward is not so much competing with the larger underlying players but using them to provide underlying services and building a value add on top, see Heroku for example
* Training AI is not sensitive to latency, if it takes a few extra seconds, or minutes or even hours it's probably ok.
* Data gravity is vastly outweighed by the cost of training the AI I think.
* A lot of these token based solutions that have been around a few years are already running close to their maximum token supply, so work factor may become a real problem

* Nosana $NOS https://nosana.io/ - As the global AI revolution expands, the demand for AI inference surges as many projects seek to train and evaluate their AI models. Consequently, a significant shortage of GPUs, crucial for executing this vital aspect of any AI project, has emerged, potentially leading to inflated costs. Furthermore, many expect these costs to soar as AI models become increasingly sophisticated.
* Synesis $SNS One The AI training data market will expand substantially across various sectors. However, the dominance of major tech corporations exploiting extensive consumer data raises concerns about privacy and individual autonomy. Synesis One aims to revolutionize this landscape.

* Bittensor Presently, the training of AI models necessitates extensive computing resources and data, primarily accessible to major corporations like Google, IBM, or Microsoft. However, this centralization leads to isolated AI models. Consequently, Bittensor works to democratize AI and machine learning, reshaping them into public resources reliant on cooperation and peer-to-peer interactions.
