DeepBrain Chain (DBC) is a blockchain-based decentralized AI computing platform designed to lower the costs of AI computational power. It integrates blockchain technology to offer a distributed GPU cloud computing network, which not only reduces costs by up to 70% for AI companies but also aims to democratize access to AI computing resources【17†source】【19†source】.

The platform was developed with the intention to address the high costs associated with AI computing power, especially given the rapid iteration of AI hardware like GPUs. By leveraging blockchain, DeepBrain Chain provides a scalable and cost-efficient solution, allowing for the pooling of GPU resources which can be accessed and shared by AI developers globally【18†source】.

DBC's business model includes a token system where the DBC token facilitates transactions within the network, such as payment for AI computational power. This ecosystem is further enriched by programs like the Skynet Initiative, which focuses on expanding the network of nodes capable of contributing computational power【23†source】.

The project also ventured into creating a specialized marketplace for AI tokens with the proposed launch of the DeepToken Exchange, although this move has seen limited interest and raises questions about the strategic direction and the immediate utility of the DBC token within this new exchange【23†source】.

Despite its ambitious setup and the potential to impact the AI and blockchain sectors significantly, DeepBrain Chain faces challenges such as intense competition in the decentralized AI space, a need for stronger marketing efforts, and technical issues with its web presence that could affect user trust and adoption rates【22†source】.

Overall, DeepBrain Chain represents a noteworthy attempt to integrate AI and blockchain technologies to solve real industry problems, particularly those related to the cost and accessibility of AI computing resources. However, the success of such a platform will heavily depend on the execution of its technological promises and the broader adoption of its network and token system.
